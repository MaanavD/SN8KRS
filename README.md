# SN8KRS

SN8KRS is a peer-to-peer shoe trading website.

What do we offer?

Buyer and seller protection

In the ideal transaction, a buyer will find a shoe that they are interested and pay us. Once the buyer has paid us, we notify the seller to ship the pair of shoes. Once the buyer recieves the shoes and notifies us that they are satisfied with the product, we transfer the money to the seller without charging any fees or premium.

If a buyer is unsatisifed with the product, they will have to send the shoes back to the seller in the condition that they were recieved. We wait for confirmation that they recieved the shoes, and return the money to the buyer without charging any fees or premium.
